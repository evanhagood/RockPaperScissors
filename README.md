# RockPaperScissors
Server-based tictactoe game (currently LAN only)


# Academic Honesty
This program was written 100% by me. However, due to restrictions in posting academic content online, I cannot post the code here. I have included psuedocode for the most important parts and screenshots that show the functionality of both programs, both the server and the client. If you are interested in seeing the full code, please contact me at evanmhagood@gmail.com

# RPS Server
-- description of server
    - handles multiple connections at the same time
    - currently LAN only (however with port forwarding, can easily be extended to WAN)
    - uses JavaFX for GUI
    - has a complete working console that shows when clients connect and disconnect

##
it has been awhile since I have ran this application and I cannot get JavaFX to import correctly. This seems to be a recurring theme with JavaFX and I should have stuck with Swing.
Anways, I will update this repo with this information when I get it working again.
